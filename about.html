      <h1>About MTN.fire</h1>

      <p>
        MTN.fire is where real stories meet the unshakable truth of the Gospel. Each episode blends raw testimony, scripture, and honest conversation, no sugarcoating, no watered-down faith. From the Appalachian mountains to the ends of the earth, this is about carrying the fire of God into everyday life. We talk about the valleys and the victories, the moments when faith feels easy and the nights when it’s a fight to keep believing. Whether it’s unpacking personal trials, or sharing how God’s moved in powerful ways, <strong>MTN.fire</strong> is here to remind you: <strong>Jesus still changes everything</strong>. If you’re looking for bold truth, gritty hope, and a spark to keep your faith alive - welcome to the fire. 
      </p>
          <p>What you’ll hear on MTN.fire:</p>

          <li><strong>Scripture first.</strong> We open the Word and let it read us back.</li>
          <li><strong>Testimony with teeth.</strong> Real stories that silence lies and stir faith.</li>
          <li><strong>Straight talk.</strong> No sugarcoating, just honest conversation about following Jesus in real life.</li> 
          <li><strong>Room to respond.</strong> We pray, we invite, and we believe for freedom together.</li>

      <div class="prose">
        <p><strong>Hey, I’m Matt</strong>— dad, son, friend, storyteller, musician and most importantly, follower of Jesus. I started MTN.fire because I’m convinced the Church doesn’t need more polish; we need <strong>presence</strong>—the real, chain-breaking presence of Jesus.</p> 

        <p>I’ve walked through compromise and the long road back. I’ve felt the weight of shame and the miracle of mercy. The cross found me in that place, and the Lord began to heal what I thought would always hurt. Now my mission is simple: <strong>tell the truth</strong>, <strong>point to Jesus</strong>, and <strong>help people guard what God has restored</strong>.</p>

    

        <p><strong>Some human stuff:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Home base:</strong> Norton, Va (most alive in the mountains and around a campfire)</li> 
            <li><strong>Simple joys:</strong> Coffee, Guitars, Road Trips, The Lake</li> 
        </ul>

        <p>If a recent episode hit home, tell someone your story, your testimony is a sword. And if you need prayer or you’re carrying something heavy, I’d be honored to stand with you.</p> 

        <p><strong>Jesus still changes everything.</strong> Let’s keep the fire burning.</p>

## 🔥 Unashamed Testimony
**Scripture:** *Luke 9:24* - “For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.”

There’s a quote that has echoed through generations of believers:  
> *“He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose.”*  
Jim Elliot wrote that line in his journal before his feet ever touched the sand of Ecuador. He was young, brilliant, full of life - but even more than that, he was *surrendered.*

He and four other men - Nate Saint, Ed McCully, Roger Youderian, and Pete Fleming - set out to reach a remote tribe known as the Waorani (called the “Auca” in that time). They weren’t chasing fame or adventure. They were chasing souls.

They prayed, they planned, they flew overhead dropping gifts and calling words of peace.  
And one January morning in 1956, they landed on a small beach they named “Palm Beach.”  
At first, there was laughter. Smiles. The first fragile bridge between two worlds.  
But fear and misunderstanding crept back into the hearts of the tribe.  
A rumor spread - a belief that the outsiders had hurt one of their own.  
And with that, the jungle went silent.

Spears were raised.  
And five men of God stood unarmed before eternity.

They had guns… but they refused to use them.  
Because they hadn’t come to kill the people they were called to love.  
They came to give.  
To the world, it looked like foolishness.  
To Heaven, it looked like faith.

And when their blood hit that sand, Heaven began counting the harvest.

## 💭 The Cost and the Call
It’s easy to romanticize faith like that from a distance - to see it as legendary, untouchable.  
But the truth is, what happened on that beach wasn’t about heroism. It was about obedience.

Jim Elliot didn’t wake up wanting to die.  
He woke up wanting to *live* - fully, completely, in reckless surrender to the One who gave him breath.  
His death wasn’t the point. His obedience was.  
And because of that obedience, the same tribe that once raised spears later raised hands in worship.  
Jim’s wife, Elisabeth, and Nate Saint’s sister, Rachel, went back into that jungle - not with vengeance, but with forgiveness.  
Grace returned to the place where blood was spilled.  
And redemption took root where fear had once ruled.

## ⚔️ Unashamed in the Fire
That’s what *Unashamed Testimony* is really about.  
Not everyone will face spears or jungles. But we all face moments where faith costs us something.  
Moments where standing for Jesus feels like standing alone.  
Moments where surrender feels like loss.

But the truth of Luke 9:24 still stands:  
> “Whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will save it.”

It’s a kingdom paradox - the more you let go, the more Heaven fills your hands.  
The world calls it loss. Heaven calls it victory.

## 🔥 Your Turn
You might not be called to a jungle in Ecuador.  
But you *are* called to a world that’s just as broken.  
And the question still stands: *What are you willing to lose for the sake of what can’t be taken away?*

Maybe it’s comfort.  
Maybe it’s reputation.  
Maybe it’s control.

Whatever it is, give it.  
Because when we live unashamed - when we stop bargaining with God and simply say *yes* - every demon in the room loses leverage.

Your story might not end on a riverbank, but it can still shake eternity.

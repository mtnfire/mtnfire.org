This week has been heavy. Not just because of headlines or what’s trending, but because you can feel the weight of hurt, anger, and division everywhere you look.

Here’s the truth: hate doesn’t heal. Revenge doesn’t restore. Division doesn’t set anyone free. But you know what does?
Love. Forgiveness. Jesus.

Only Jesus can take the ashes of hurt and turn them into fire for healing. Only He can bring unity where there’s been strife. Only He can restore peace when the world feels torn apart.

Let’s choose to walk in that kind of love, not just when it’s easy, but when it’s hardest.

✝️ “Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.” – 1 Peter 4:8 (ESV)

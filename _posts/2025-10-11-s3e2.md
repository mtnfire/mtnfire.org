## Fear vs. Faith: When the Stones Start Flying  

There are moments when fear doesn’t just whisper-it roars.  
When you can feel it in your chest. When it makes you question everything you thought you believed.  

That’s where Stephen stood.  
The first martyr of the early church, surrounded by an angry mob, accused of blasphemy, and staring down the same council that condemned Jesus.  

Most of us-if we’re honest-would have gone silent.  
But Stephen looked higher.  

> “But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.”  
> - *Acts 7:55*

### The Clash of Fear and Faith  

Fear looks around.  
Faith looks up.  

Stephen’s story in Acts 6–7 isn’t just about courage in the face of death-it’s about vision.  
He saw something greater than the stones. He saw the Savior.  

Everywhere else in Scripture, after the ascension, Jesus is **seated** at the right hand of God-resting in victory.  
But here, for Stephen, He **stood**.  

Why?  
Because heaven doesn’t stay seated when faith stands up.  
Because when the world throws stones, Jesus gets to His feet.

### The Standing Savior  

Picture that moment. The roar of the crowd fades. Dust fills the air.  
And there-on the edge of eternity-the Son of God stands to welcome His servant home.  

That’s not just Stephen’s reward. That’s ours too.  
Every act of faith, every quiet stand, every unseen obedience-it all moves heaven.  

Faith may not silence fear, but it will always outlast it.

### The Faith That Stands  

It’s easy to admire Stephen from a distance, but what does standing look like for us today?  

Sometimes it’s refusing to join in gossip when everyone else does.  
Sometimes it’s praying with your kid when fear grips their heart.  
Sometimes it’s choosing forgiveness when bitterness would feel easier.  

Faith isn’t loud. Faith is loyal.  
It stands when no one else does.  
It stands when the stones start flying.  

> “After you have done everything, stand.”  
> - *Ephesians 6:13*

### The Stones We Carry  

Sometimes the stones aren’t in other people’s hands-they’re in ours.  
Shame. Regret. Guilt. Self-condemnation.  

We pick them up and throw them at ourselves.  
But Jesus took those stones too.  
Every accusation that could have hit you, hit Him instead.  

That’s why Stephen could forgive while dying-because he saw the cross clearer than the crowd.  
Maybe faith, for you, starts with dropping the stones you’ve been carrying.

### A Personal Word  

I know what it’s like to live under fear.  
PTSD, anxiety, depression-they were my daily reality.  
There were nights I couldn’t sleep, days when panic came out of nowhere, and moments when it felt like life was slipping through my fingers.  

But like Stephen, I had to lift my eyes.  
One night, broken and desperate at 3 a.m., I cried out to Jesus. That was the moment salvation came-not because I fought my way out, but because I finally looked up.  

Healing came later, but peace began when my vision shifted.  

> “I sought the Lord, and He answered me; He delivered me from all my fears.”  
> - *Psalm 34:4*  

Fear still tries to whisper, but now I know where to look.

### The Takeaway  

Faith grows by what you focus on.  
If you stare at the chaos, fear multiplies.  
If you stare at Christ, faith multiplies.  

> “Fix your eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith.”  
> - *Hebrews 12:2*

When we see Him clearly, fear loses its power.

### The Prayer  

Lord Jesus, thank You that You stood for Stephen-and that You stand for us.  
When fear tries to take over, remind us that You have already overcome.  
Fill us with faith that looks up instead of looking around.  
Give us boldness, peace, and vision.  
Let Your love drive out fear, and let Your Spirit keep us standing.  
In Your name, Amen.

### Closing Thought  

Fear vs. faith-it’s not just Stephen’s story.  
It’s ours.  
When fear rises, look up. The Savior still stands.  

> “When I am afraid, I put my trust in You.” - *Psalm 56:3*

**Testimony. Truth. Fire.**

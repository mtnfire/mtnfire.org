### Faith Under Fire 🔥  
 
Season 3 of *MTN.fire* was more than a collection of episodes - it was a proving ground.  
 
We walked through fire with Stephen.  
We learned endurance from Richard Wurmbrand.  
We saw forgiveness through the Groenewald family.  
And we discovered what it truly means to stand unashamed when the world demands silence.  
 
Every story, every flame, every tear-stained moment carried the same truth:  
**The Gospel still advances with power.**

This season wasn’t about polished faith.  
It was about *refined* faith - the kind that’s been tested and still burns bright.  
It reminded us that courage doesn’t always roar.  
Sometimes, it simply stands.  
 
If you’ve been following the journey from Episode 1 all the way to *The Reckoning: Eternity on the Line*,  
thank you.  
Your prayers, your messages, and your faith have kept this fire burning.

But the mission isn’t over.  
In fact… it’s just getting started.  
 
Season 4 is already in motion.  
The title? **Preparing for Battle.**  
 
> *“The fire forged us. Now it’s time to fight.”*  
 
It’s time to move from endurance to engagement -  
from testimony to transformation.  
 
We’ve seen what faith can endure.  
Now, we’ll see what faith can conquer.

### Until then…  
Keep your eyes on eternity.  
Keep your heart on fire.  
And never forget -  
the same God who met you in the fire is the one who leads you through the fight.

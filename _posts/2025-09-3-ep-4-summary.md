Keep The Fire

Campfires don’t die in a flash—they fade inch by inch when nobody tends them. Same with your soul.

On March 31st, Jesus healed me. PTSD, anxiety, depression—gone. I walked out of that church lighter than I’d been in years. But the very next morning I realized something: fires don’t stay lit by accident. If I didn’t feed this, it would fade—not because God is weak, but because neglect is a wet blanket.

Paul told Timothy, “Fan into flame the gift of God.” (2 Tim 1:6) That’s active language. Movement. Breath. Intention. You don’t babysit a flame—you work it. Back in Leviticus, God commanded that the altar fire “shall be kept burning; it shall not go out” (Lev. 6:12–13). What He starts, we’re called to steward.

Fuel the Flame

A fire won’t last if you just stare at it—you have to carry wood to it. In the same way, zeal doesn’t stay alive unless you keep feeding it. Word, prayer, and worship are the fuel.

For me, that looks like ten minutes I don’t skip:

A Psalm, read out loud.

A short Gospel passage, asking “What does this show me about Jesus today?”

One minute of prayer—thank Him for one gift, ask for one grace.

Simple fuel. But consistent fuel.

Build a Windbreak

Campfires also need protection. If the wind kicks up, the flame flickers or blows out. That’s why we build rings of stone or stack logs around them. Boundaries don’t suffocate passion—they protect it.

Proverbs 4:23 says, “Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life.”
What you let in—or keep out—shapes whether your flame burns steady. The shows you watch, the voices you follow, the habits you keep—do they feed, fan, or freeze?

Stir the Coals

Even a healthy fire goes flat if it’s never stirred. The embers need poked. The way we stir is through outflow—testimony and service. Revelation 12:11 says we overcome “by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of our testimony.”

Every time I share what God did for me, it throws a spark on someone else’s woodpile—and it keeps my own coals alive. Serving, encouraging, praying with others—this is how the flame grows hotter, not colder.

Don’t Let It Die on Your Watch

If God’s lit something in you, tend it. Guard it. Stir it. It’s not a museum piece—it’s a living fire.

🔥 Ask Him today:

What’s my one fuel?

What’s my one windbreak?

What’s my one act?

Write them down. Act on them. Let the flame keep burning.

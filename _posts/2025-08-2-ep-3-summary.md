Episode 3 of MTN.fire, titled "The Cross Is Enough," focuses on living in freedom after overcoming past struggles. The episode begins with a recap of previous episodes, emphasizing the cost of compromise and the importance of protecting what has been reclaimed. It then delves into Colossians 2:14-15, explaining how Jesus' sacrifice canceled our debts and disarmed the enemy. Matt shares a personal story of overcoming shame and temptation by declaring the truth of Jesus' victory. The episode also draws a parallel with the story of Barabbas, highlighting the concept of substitution and the power of testimony. Practical steps for renewing the mind and living in freedom are provided, including recognizing and replacing lies with truth, sharing testimonies, and maintaining spiritual practices. The episode concludes with an invitation to accept Jesus' freedom, and a prayer of freedom.

Romans 12:2 says, “Be transformed by the renewing of your mind.”
2 Corinthians 10:4–5 says our weapons demolish strongholds, and we “take every thought captive to obey Christ.”
Here’s the picture: at the cross, your chains broke. In your mind, the links may still feel familiar. Renewal is how your thinking learns the new freedom your spirit already has.

When you have those thoughts…

	1. Notice — Catch the thought in the act. What did I just agree with?
	2. Name — Call it what it is: a lie. (Not “my truth,” not “my personality”—a lie.)
	3. Nail — Take it to the cross: “Jesus, this was nailed with my record—canceled and disarmed.”
	4. Narrate — Replace it out loud with Scripture truth. (Truth isn’t shy; say it.)

Handles — Walk Free This Week

our simple practices to live what we just talked about, do it on purpose, and watch your mind catch up to what Jesus already finished.
	
	1. Rename the Record - When accusation hits, say out loud: “Paid in full. Canceled. Nailed. Disarmed.” (Col 2:14–15)
	2. Rehearse the Triumph (60 seconds) - Picture the IOU on His cross. Picture the enemy’s empty hands. Pray: “Jesus, You stripped the powers. I stand in Your victory.”
	3. Release Your Testimony (one person) - Two sentences: text or tell what Jesus already changed in you. (Rev 12:11)
	4. Guard the Gain (10-minute rule) - Give God the first 10 minutes: Colossians 2, prayer, and one spoken truth over your life.

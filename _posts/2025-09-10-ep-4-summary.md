If you had to write your name based on your wounds, what would it be?  

For some, it might read *Broken*. For others, *Failure*. Maybe *Not Enough*. Pain and people have a way of branding us with names we were never meant to carry. Abuse whispers lies into your bloodstream. Addiction stamps you with shame. Rejection tattoos “not enough” across your forehead.  

I know, because I’ve worn those names myself. There were seasons where my identity felt hijacked — where I looked in the mirror and saw nothing but fear, anxiety, and failure staring back. And after you’ve lived under those labels long enough, you stop arguing with them. You start to answer to a name God never wrote.  

But here’s the truth: the enemy doesn’t get the final word. John 10:10 says, *“The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I came that they may have life and have it abundantly.”* That includes your identity.  

God has already spoken a better name over you. Romans 12:2 reminds us that we’re not called to conform to the world’s labels but to be transformed by the renewal of our minds. And in Christ, we are brand new — not patched-up, not duct-taped together, but a brand-new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17).  

The world says *Addict.* God says *Free.*  
The world says *Abandoned.* God says *Adopted.*  
The world says *Worthless.* God says *Chosen.*  
The world says *Dirty.* God says *Clean.*  

So here’s the challenge: stop answering to the wrong name. Write down the lies you’ve believed about yourself. Then open the Word and find the truth that replaces them. Speak that truth over yourself until it sticks deeper than the wound. This isn’t wishful thinking — it’s warfare.  

And when you start living under the name God has given you, everything changes. You walk lighter. You breathe freer. You know who you are.  

This is the heartbeat of Episode 5 of Season 2 of the MTN.fire podcast: **“Who Names You?”** I invite you to listen, reflect, and let God rewrite your name.

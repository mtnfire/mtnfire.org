The car might be gone. But your feet still work, your mouth still speaks, and the Spirit still burns in your chest. God has always been a God who makes a way in the wilderness. If the Red Sea had Uber, Israel would’ve missed the miracle.
You’re not abandoned. You’re being refined. And whatever's ahead - job, provision, even the next ride, you don’t have to figure it all out tonight. Just breathe. Let yourself grieve it. And then give that grief to God.

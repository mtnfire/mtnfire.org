# Fireside Chats - The Start of Something Real

Sometimes the best ministry doesn’t happen behind a mic stand or studio setup.  
Sometimes it happens when the cameras slow down, the lights dim, and it’s just two people being honest about what God’s doing *right now*.

That’s the heartbeat behind **Fireside Chats** - a new branch of MTN.fire that’s raw, unpolished, and deeply personal.  
No outlines. No production polish. Just truth, presence, and the kind of conversation that feels like sitting by a fire with a friend.

## Why I Started Fireside Chats

MTN.fire has always been about testimony - *truth told through the flames.*  
But I felt God nudging me to show the *quieter* side of that: the moments between the big stories, the lessons that come through stillness and reflection.

**Fireside Chats** is my answer to that call.  
It’s a space to slow down, breathe, and talk about the things that don’t always make it into a sermon - real faith, real struggle, real hope.

> “The fire God started in us isn’t meant to stop with us - it’s meant to be carried forward.”

## Episode 1 - *“Welcome to Fireside Chats”*

The very first episode was simple - just me sharing the heart behind this new direction.  
No script, no guest, just a chance to welcome you into what this space will be:  
honest talk, quiet moments, and reflections on what God’s been showing me lately.  
It set the tone - unfiltered, personal, and full of heart.

## Episode 2 - *“Making Heaven Crowded”* (with Henley)

Then came something I’ll never forget - my first guest.  
My daughter, **Henley**, joined me for the second episode, and what came out of that conversation was nothing short of special.  
We talked about faith through her eyes - prayer, favorite verses, what it means to have a fire for Jesus - and it reminded me why this matters so much.

Our kids don’t just inherit our name; they inherit our example.  
They watch how we pray, how we trust, how we love.  
And that’s what *Making Heaven Crowded* was all about - showing that the fire of faith is meant to be passed on, one generation at a time.

## What Comes Next

Fireside Chats will continue alongside the main MTN.fire podcast - shorter, more conversational, and centered on the real stories happening around us.  
Sometimes it’ll be friends. Sometimes family. Sometimes just me and a mic late at night.  

Every episode will carry that same heartbeat:  
🔥 **Real faith. Real life. Real fire.**

If these moments speak to you, share them.  
If they stir something in you, talk about it.  
And if you’ve got your own story - your own spark - don’t keep it quiet.  
This is how we make heaven crowded.

Thanks for sitting by the fire with me.  
**Keep it burning - and keep passing it on.**

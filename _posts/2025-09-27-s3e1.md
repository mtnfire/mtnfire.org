# The Reckoning Begins: Why Being Unashamed of Christ Isn’t Optional  

Romans 1:16 says it plain:  

> *“For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes — to the Jew first and also to the Greek.”*  

Paul doesn’t call the gospel an opinion, a tradition, or a suggestion. He calls it **power**. And power can’t stay silent. Power draws a line. Power demands a response.  

## The Dividing Line  
We live in a world that celebrates compromise. Keep your faith quiet. Don’t offend. Don’t stand out. But Jesus never left that option on the table.  

He said in Matthew 10:33: *“Whoever denies me before men, I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.”*  

That’s not harsh. That’s holy. Following Him has always been bold, public, and costly.  

The cross was public. The tomb was public. His return will be public.  
So our faith must be public.  

## The Hard Question  
Here’s the question that matters:  

**If your faith was put on trial today… would there be enough evidence to convict you?**  

Would your life — your words, your choices, your priorities — point clearly to Jesus?  
Or would the jury only see silence, compromise, neutrality?  

Because let’s be honest: a compromise of living the way *you* want for a little while here on Earth could have **eternal consequences**.  

Do you really want to risk that? Trading eternal glory for fleeting moments of comfort, acceptance, or applause?  

## The Cost of Following Jesus  
Following Jesus will cost you.  

- It may cost you relationships.  
- It may cost you opportunities.  
- It may cost you reputation.  
- It will definitely cost you comfort.  

But the cost of compromise is greater. Compromise isn’t just about losing influence here — it’s about losing eternity.  

## My Story  
I’ve lived this. Since I started walking in my calling and launching this podcast, I’ve lost some lifelong friends. People I thought would always be there. The phone went quiet. Messages went unanswered.  

That hurt. But I’ve realized something: I’d rather be rejected by man than rejected by God.  

The truth is, I was never bold before. I was shy, timid, afraid to stand up for myself. But since Jesus set me on this path, everything has changed.  

Now, I don’t mind stopping to talk to anyone about Him. I’ve put my whole testimony out in the open. I’m not ashamed — because it’s not about me. It’s about what He’s done in my life.  

## This Season Ahead  
That’s why this season of MTN.fire is focused on boldness. We’ll look at men and women through history who refused to be ashamed, even when it cost them everything. Some were mocked, some imprisoned, some martyred.  

Yet their voices still echo today. Their courage still challenges us. Their faith still inspires us.  

The reckoning isn’t just about what we say in a safe place. It’s about what we’ll stand for when the world turns against us.  

## A Call to Stand  
This is not the season for private Christianity. The line has already been drawn.  

So the call is simple:  
**Be unashamed. Stand bold. Live loud. Pay the price — because He paid it first.**  

And when the pressure comes, remember: eternity is worth every cost.

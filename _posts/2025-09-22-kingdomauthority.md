# ⚔️ Don’t Focus on the Individual  

*"Don’t focus on the individual, focus on the darkness that made that individual evil."*  

That line hit me hard - because it’s the essence of Kingdom authority. Too often, we spend our energy battling people, when the real fight is spiritual.  

Ephesians 6:12 reminds us:  
*"For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places."*  

The enemy would love for us to waste our strength on the wrong battlefield. If we fight *people*, bitterness grows. But when we recognize the darkness behind the attack, we fight with the right weapons - prayer, truth, authority in Jesus’ name.

## Esther’s Example  

Esther could have shrunk back and said, *“This is too big for me.”* But Mordecai reminded her that God had placed her in the kingdom *for such a time as this.* She wasn’t fighting Haman as a man - she was standing against the darkness trying to destroy God’s people.

## What About Us?  

When someone hurts us, betrays us, or opposes us, the temptation is to focus on them. To carry resentment. To see *them* as the problem.  

But Kingdom authority calls us higher. It calls us to see the real enemy at work and to take our stand in prayer, in the Word, and in faith.  

The devil’s method has always been **divide and conquer**. He tries to set us against each other so we never realize he’s the one pulling the strings.

## The Challenge  

Think of the conflict you’re facing right now. The person who seems to be against you. The situation that feels unfair.  

What if you shifted your focus? What if you prayed not against the person, but against the darkness trying to use them?  

Don’t waste your strength swinging at shadows. Call it what it is. Stand in Kingdom authority.  

Because your battle isn’t with flesh and blood - and your victory isn’t in revenge. It’s in Jesus.

# The Next Mountain – Season 2 Finale

When the fire clears, you’re left standing - lighter, stronger, refined.  
The ashes settle, and for the first time, you can see beyond the smoke.  
And there it is: **the next mountain.**

## Looking Back

Season 2 of MTN.fire has been about refinement:  
- storms that shook us,  
- anchors that held us,  
- fires that burned away what wasn’t real.  

And through it all, **God was faithful.**

We’ve seen how trials test us, but also how they prepare us.  
Every step - even the hardest ones - leads somewhere.

## Mountains in Scripture

Mountains aren’t just scenery in the Bible.  
They are places of **testing, encounter, and revelation.**

- **Mount Sinai** - *“The mountain trembled with fire and smoke as God gave His covenant”* (Exodus 19:18–20).  
- **Calvary** - where Jesus carried the cross, and salvation was secured (Luke 23:33).  
- **The Mount of Transfiguration** - where Jesus shone in glory before His disciples (Matthew 17:1–2).  

Every mountain carried weight. Every mountain changed everything.

## Your Next Mountain

Psalm 121:1–2 reminds us:  
> *“I lift up my eyes to the hills-where does my help come from?  
> My help comes from the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth.”*

So let me ask you: **what’s your next mountain?**  

- Maybe it’s *freedom* - breaking from old habits or addictions.  
- Maybe it’s *healing* - walking out of grief, trauma, or wounds.  
- Maybe it’s *calling* - stepping into what God has whispered to your heart.  
- Or maybe it’s *faith itself* - daring to believe again.  

Whatever it is, the same God who stood with you in the fire will walk with you up the mountain.

## The Mountain of Perspective

From the valley, all you can see are obstacles.  
From the climb, all you can feel is the struggle.  
But from the peak, you see **how far God has carried you.**

James 1:2–4 says:  
> *“Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,  
> for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.  
> And let steadfastness have its full effect,  
> that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.”*

And Job, after his suffering, declared:  
> *“My ears had heard of you, but now my eyes have seen you.”* (Job 42:5)  

That’s what the mountain does. It takes what you’ve *heard* about God and turns it into something you’ve *lived.*

## The Next Mountain for MTN.fire

From the beginning, MTN.fire was never just a podcast.  
It’s a vision. A calling. A fire God lit inside me.  

The next mountain is boldness.  
It’s courage.  
It’s living unashamed.  

Season 3 will be **The Reckoning: Unashamed** - a call to live with bold faith in a world that pushes back.  

---

## Final Word

Your story doesn’t end in the valley.  
It doesn’t end in the storm.  
It doesn’t end in the fire.  

God doesn’t leave us where we are - **He calls us higher.**  
The mountain is waiting.

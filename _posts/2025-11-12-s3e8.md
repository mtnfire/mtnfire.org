### The Reckoning

Every story we’ve told this season led here.

The fire of Stephen’s boldness.  
The chains of Richard Wurmbrand.  
The scars of the Groenewald family.  
Each testimony has carried a piece of the same truth:  
**the Gospel still advances with power.**

And now - the question turns to us.

### When Faith Meets the Edge of Eternity

*What if your faith was tested at the edge of eternity?*  
Could you stand unashamed?

Revelation 12 : 11 says:  
> “They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony.”

That’s the heartbeat of *The Reckoning.*  
It’s not about fear of the end - it’s about readiness for it.  
Because when your life belongs to Christ, even your final breath becomes a declaration:  
**Jesus is worth it all.**

### The Fire That Tests and Refines

Every believer faces a reckoning - not of judgment, but of *devotion.*  
When comfort and conviction collide, only fire can reveal what’s real.  

It’s easy to praise God when the mountains glow with victory.  
But what about when the valleys echo with silence?  
What about when the prayers go unanswered, the doors close, and the world calls you foolish for standing firm?

That’s where faith stops being theory and becomes testimony.  
That’s where eternity whispers, *“Hold the line.”*

Because our faith isn’t meant to survive the fire - it’s meant to shine in it.

### The Call to Stand

This episode is a charge to every believer who’s grown weary:  
**Don’t dim your light to fit into a fading world.**

You were born for this generation.  
Born to carry the fire that the world forgot.  
Born to live for the King, even when the kingdom costs you everything.

The world doesn’t need quieter Christians - it needs burning ones.  
And when you stand unashamed, you remind hell that the cross still wins.

### Eternal Perspective

When your eyes are on eternity, fear loses its grip.  
Death loses its voice.  
And the Gospel moves through you like wind through embers.

This isn’t the end of a podcast season - it’s the beginning of a movement.  
Season 3 closes with a call to courage.  
Season 4 begins with preparation for battle.  

The fire doesn’t fade here - it multiplies.

### Takeaway

> The Gospel cannot be chained.  
> The light cannot be silenced.  
> And eternity is still on the line.

This is *The Reckoning.*

So stand unashamed.  
Speak the truth.  
Live for what outlives you.  
Because the same Spirit that sustained the saints before us now burns within you.

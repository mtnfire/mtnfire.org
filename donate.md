  <p>
    <strong>MTN.fire</strong> isn’t a brand — it’s a testimony in motion.  
    Every episode, post, and design exists to share the fire of Jesus — the kind that restores hope, breaks chains, and sets hearts ablaze again.

    If this ministry has encouraged you, challenged you, or helped you find strength in your walk,  
    you can help keep the message burning by supporting below.

    Your support helps cover production, hosting, design, and outreach costs —  
    but more than that, it helps share the message of redemption and hope to people who need it most.
